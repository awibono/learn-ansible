# Learn Ansible

##### All the stored password in this repository is not important. So, isn't a big problem if I pushed a password, vault file, and SSH Key. Also, I've been written wiki pages for this repo. It will be used for the tutorial.


#### Folder Path
`ssh/` the folder is used for storing SSH Key that will be used on the local workstation and on the remote machine.

`platform/` the folder is used for storing Vagrantfile that used for testing the playbooks.

`provisioning/` folder is used for storing `roles`, `inventory`, and `ansible.cfg`.


#### Vault Password File
`.learn-ansible-vault` a is used for vault password. Used for encrypting and decrypt.
